# BuckleScript's artifacts are installed upon package installation; they resides
# here. Merlin's jump-to-location can transport you to these locations!

# S for source

# TODO: put BuckleScript ppx here too

# Merlin picks up the artifacts of the compilation, so **don't forget** to
# compile your project at least once (through `run.sh` naturally) in order to
# have these artifacts in the first place!

# **Note**: this also means that, when you add a new file, you need to compile
# it once to generates the new artifacts for Merlin. Practically, if you have a
# watcher installed, it'll only take a few seconds top for the change to
# "propagate" to your editor's plugin.
